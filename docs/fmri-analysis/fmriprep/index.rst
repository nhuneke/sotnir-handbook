==============================================

------------------------------------------

`fMRIPrep <https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/>`_ is a `NiPreps <http://www.nipreps.org>`_ application for preprocessing 
task-based and resting-state fMRI.

The idea is that this application provides a common, comprehensive pipeline that can be carried out across
multiple studies to allow a reproducible neuroimaging analysis workflow.

fMRIPrep is installed on ``uos-210028`` and ``uos-211997``. If you are installing on
a personal machine (not recommended) then you can find installation instructions 
`here <https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/installation.html>`_. Please install as a docker
image.

If you are new to fMRI preprocessing, then please see the :doc:`introductory guide </fmri-analysis/fmriprep/guide-for-newbs>`.
