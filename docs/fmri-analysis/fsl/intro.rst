FEAT
----

Launch FSL FEAT GUI
*******************

In the terminal, type ``fsl &`` to launch FSL, and click on the "FEAT FMRI Analysis" icon to launch the FEAT GUI.

.. tip:: Navigating to the data folder first

    It is recommended that the command is called after navigating to the directory where the data is located, so that loading the image data will be easier.

.. tip:: Avoiding spaces in file and folder names

    Avoiding having spaces in the file and folder names. This is considered a good practice in general when operating in Unix/Linux environment. Consider replacing spaces with underscores or dashes.

(Optional) Load FEAT Configuration
**********************************

If you have a FEAT configuration file (``.fsf``) from a previous analysis, you can load it by clicking on the **Load** button. This will import all the settings from the configuration file, and you'll be able to modify from there.

Slice timing correction
***********************

Click on the "Pre-stats" tab, and select "Slice timing correction" from the drop-down menu. Choose "Use slice timings file", and select the file that corresponds to the input data. The file should be a text file with one number per line, corresponding to the slice acquisition order. 

.. important:: Check whether your DICOM data contains slice timing information

    It is important to check with radiographer whether the DICOM data contains slice timing information. Data collected UHS MRI scanners undergo anonymisation process, which can remove slice timing information before the data is transferred to the user. Typically, slice timing information can be preserved when the DICOM images are burnt onto a DVD from the scanners.

Normalisation
*************

You'll need to choose brain atlas for this step. In FSL there are a range of standard brain atlases available, in which we will be using the MNI152 T1 2mm atlas (``MNI152_T1_2mm_brain.nii.gz``). This is a commonly used standard brain in neuroimaging research.

.. tip:: How to find the path of FSL installation

    In a terminal, type ``whereis fsl``. This will return the path of the FSL installation.

Run FEAT
********

You are now ready to run FEAT. Press **Go** to start the analysis. FEAT should normally take a few minutes to complete. 

Viewing FEAT Analyses Results
-----------------------------

In a file browser (e.g. Windows File Explorer), navigate to the output folder of the FEAT analysis. This folder should end with the suffix ``.feat``. Inside this folder, there should be a file called ``report.html``. Double-clicking on this file, a web browser should open and display the status and results of the FEAT analysis, which is a convenient way to view the results. 

While FEAT analysis is still running, it will display "STILL RUNNING" in the main page. When the analysis is complete, open FSLeyes and load the preprocessed fMRI image (``filtered_func_data``) from the ``.feat`` folder.

FSLeyes: a brief intro
**********************

`FSLeyes <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLeyes>`_ is the image viewer released with FSL version â‰¥ 5.0.10. FSLeyes does not perform any processing or analysis on images.

A complete user guide of FSLeyes can be found `here <https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/fsl/fsleyes/fsleyes/userdoc/>`_. FSLEyes has the following features:

* Orthographic (3 orthogonal slicings) and lightbox (multiple slices) views
* Multiple simultaneous views (orthographic and/or lightbox)
* Timeseries display (via graphs or movie loops)
* Multiple semi-transparent colour-overlays
* Simple freehand image editing (mask drawing)
* 3D rendering

Brain Extraction Tool (BET)
---------------------------

Accurate brain extraction is crucial for carrying out structural analysis that involves segmentation. In FSL, it is straightforward to perform brain extraction by running BET, but obtaining accurate results will involve some skill and diligence.

For command-line version, you can type ``bet`` to learn about the usage description:

::

    bet <input> <output> [options]

where ``input`` and ``output`` stand for filenames, and ``options`` can be many, or none, of the available extra options. 

Varying the fractional intensity threshold parameter (-f)
**********************************************************

The ``-f`` option in ``bet`` controls the fractional intensity threshold that distinguishes brain from non-brain. By default the value is set on 0.5, and when it is smaller, the brain estimate gets larger. In command line, try setting the ``-f`` option from 0.2 to 0.8, in turn, to see the effect it has. Save these outputs with different names and load them into FSLeyes. 

Troubleshooting Brain Extraction
********************************

The section describes some of the more problematic brain extraction cases, which are common with images that have large FOV and/or substantial bias field.

Using the gradient threshold option (-g)

Dealing with large FOV

1. crop image first to remove the neck
2. provide an estimate of the centre of the brain
3. use other BET options that might be more robust

fslmaths
********

``fslmaths`` is a very general image calculator and can be used to perform a variety of manipulations of images.

As an example, here we have extracted two images from a functional dataset, ``image0`` and ``image1``. We'd like to calculate the difference between two consecutive timepoint images, which may be used as part of a quality assessment. We will call the output ``imdiff``. To do so, run the following command:

::

    fslmaths image0 -sub image1 imdiff

and view the output (`imdiff`).

Now, to calculate this as a percent difference image, run the following command:

::

    fslmaths imdiff -div image0 -mul 100 imdiffpercent

which will first take the difference image (``imdiff``), divide by the first of the original images (``image0``), multiply by 100, and output ``imdiffpercent``. View the output, and run ``fslstats``.
