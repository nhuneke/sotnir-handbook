`Nordic Neuro Lab (NNL) <https://www.nordicneurolab.com/>`_ provides the hardware and software for conducting functional MRI (fMRI) scans at UHS. Typically, NNL equipment is configured to connect with its dedicated PC to run `nordicAktiva <https://www.nordicneurolab.com/products/nordicaktiva>`_, the NNL software designed for executing fMRI paradigms. However, the NNL equipment can also be configured to work with a researcher's own PC to run custom fMRI paradigms developed in PsychoPy, MATLAB, and other software.
