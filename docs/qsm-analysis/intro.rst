Background and Theory
---------------------

Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) is sensitive to both iron and myelin, and therefore SWI is used clinically to provide additional contrast to T1 and T2 weighted images.

Role of iron in the brain
*************************

Iron is involved in regulating electrons in metabolic processes, such as the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. In addition, iron is also involved in oxygen transport in the brain via haemoglobin.

Role of myelin in the brain
***************************

Myelin forms a sheath around axons of neurons, which insulates the axons and increases the speed of electrical signal transmission.

Motivations for QSM
*******************

Iron accumulates in the brain with age and link to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. 

Clinical Applications
